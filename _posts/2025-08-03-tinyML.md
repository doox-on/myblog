Lately I’ve been curious about running some machine learning directly on small devices, so I decided to try it on my Raspberry Pi with the Camera Module. I wasn’t aiming to train a new model or build a production-ready system, just to see if I could get person detection working in real time.

### Overview

I found that TensorFlow Lite is lightweight enough to run on the Pi. The idea is pretty simple:
	1.	Use the Pi camera to grab frames.
	2.	Feed them into a pre-trained face detection/recognition model converted to TFLite.
	3.	Draw boxes around faces and label them.

At first, performance wasn’t smooth – inference latency was high, and the colors were off in my preview window. After some trial and error with the camera pipeline (resizing frames, lowering resolution, adjusting frame rate), I managed to make it look much better. Now it can run in near real time, which feels pretty amazing considering the small hardware.

This project is very much a prototype. I didn’t train the ML model myself – I just integrated an existing one and wired up the pipeline. Still, it was a good learning exercise to see how inference, pre/post-processing, and live video can all come together on such a tiny device.

Next step? Maybe hooking this into something deeper, like kernel-level event handling or even embedding this logic into a driver. But for now, I’m just glad I could get the Pi to recognize faces and draw little green boxes around them. 

### Closing thought

Sometimes it’s fun to just explore without overthinking. Running ML on a Raspberry Pi camera isn’t new, but doing it myself taught me a lot about performance trade-offs, debugging the camera stack, and what it really feels like to push “AI” down to the edge.

### Technology Stack

* **Core:** Python (with TensorFlow Lite for inference, OpenCV for image handling)
* **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 (with Camera Module 3)
* **ML Model:** Pre-trained Face Detection / Recognition model (TFLite format)
