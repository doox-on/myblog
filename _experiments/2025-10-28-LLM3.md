title: 3. (LLM) NL-JSON-SQL triplet
feature_image: "https://picsum.photos/2560/600?image=1024"
---

This weekâ€™s focus was on **building the complete NLâ€“JSONâ€“SQL pipeline**, transforming individual experimental scripts into a coherent, reproducible workflow.

After finalizing the **SQL â†’ JSON plan generator**, the next milestones were to:
1. Automatically generate SQL queries from real CSV data,  
2. Use the Groq API to produce their corresponding **natural language (NL)** and **execution plan (JSON)**, and  
3. Merge all valid outputs into a **structured training dataset** for future NL2SQL fine-tuning.

### Transition to SQL -> JSON Plans

Originally, the plan was to extract query plans from DuckDB via EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON),
but it did not support that feature yet.
I replaced it with an **LLM based JSON planner** using Groqâ€™s API. 

This new pipeline takes in an SQL query and produces a **structured JSON plan** that outlines:
- The sequence of operations (Projection, Filter, Sort, Join, etc.)
- Their conditions or parameters
- The hierarchical structure of the query

### 1. Automated SQL Query Generation

I implemented a dynamic SQL generator (`random_query.py`) that scans any CSV file, infers column types (string, int, float), and generates 500 random SQL queries based on adaptive templates.

This enables dataset-independent query generation â€” no manual schema definition required.

### 2. SQL â†’ JSON Plan Conversion

The SQL-to-JSON step was stabilized using Groqâ€™s `llama-3.1-8b-instant` model.  
Each SQL query is parsed into a **hierarchical execution plan** with explicit nodes like:
- `TableScan`, `Filter`, `Aggregation`, `Projection`, and `GroupBy`.

Invalid or malformed JSON responses are filtered automatically, ensuring only clean data propagates to the final dataset.

### ðŸ’¬ 3. SQL â†’ NL Question Generation

A parallel module (`SQL-to-NL.py`) was added to translate SQL queries into plain English questions.  
This process leverages schema-aware prompts (column descriptions embedded in context) to produce accurate, human-like phrasing.

By grounding the LLM with column descriptions, the output is both semantically correct and interpretable.

### ðŸ”— 4. Triplet Integration

After both NL and JSON files were generated, I built a **triplet merger** (`make_triplets.py`) to align (NL, SQL, JSON) into a unified `.jsonl` dataset.  
This script automatically validates JSON structure and skips corrupted entries.

### Next Steps (Week 5~6)

- Automatically generate (NL, SQL, JSON) triples using the working SQL -> JSON converter.
- Create ~500 high quality examples to train the NL -> JSON model.
- Fine-tune a lightweight Groq/Llama model to generate JSON plans directly from natural language queries.
- Compare outputs with ground-truth plans to measure semantic alignment (Plan Accuracy).
